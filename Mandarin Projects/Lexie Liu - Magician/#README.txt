You're welcome to use the USTX for whatever you want.
You can claim the files as yours and whatever I don't really mind.
You can also distribute it as well.
Just don't claim the song is yours.
Song BPM: 120
Note: There's English within the song. Please use a supported voicebank.

文件夹里的USTX是给你用的。
里面的文件可以说是你自己做的，我不太管。
你也可以把文件分发给人家。
只说歌不是你做的就行。
歌BPM: 120
注：歌里有英文歌词，请保证音库能支持英文。

Thank you, 多谢
