Romanian USTx uses mostly custom japanese phonemes, since I do not have a romanian voicebanks.
If you're using a Japanese voicebank, please note that some phonemes used will be different, the phonemes are listed below:
4 - Japanese 't'
dx - Japanese 'r'
Please replace the incompatible phonemes with an equivalent that your Japanese voicebank may support in OpenUtau.

You're welcome to use the USTX for whatever you want.
You can claim the files as yours and whatever I don't really mind.
You can also distribute it as well.
Just don't claim the song is yours.
Song BPM: 130

文件夹里的USTX是给你用的。
里面的文件可以说是你自己做的，我不太管。
你也可以把文件分发给人家。
只说歌不是你做的就行。
歌BPM: 130

Thank you, 多谢
